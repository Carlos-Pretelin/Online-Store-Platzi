# Online-Store-Platzi E.Comerce App REST API Project
Little React Store


##This Project is an online store made from a course from Platzi.com

An ecommerce React app that uses an API and custom hooks is a web application that allows users to browse and purchase products online. It is built using the React JavaScript library and utilizes custom hooks, which are functions that allow developers to reuse stateful logic across multiple components in their application.
One of the featureds of the app is that you can add items to your cart, to see a sumary of everything you have before going to checkout

### This Project is an EXAMPLE of an app that allows you to :


* Use a Rest Api that serves information to consume
* Manage several States across all the components, using useContext and other custom hooks
* Laying a structure of directories and pages using Reac-Router-Dom
